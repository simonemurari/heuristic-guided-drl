# Heuristic-Guided Distributional Reinforcement Learning

This repository hosts the code for the paper Heuristic-Guided Distributional Reinforcement Learning which explores how heuristics can be combined with distributional reinforcement learning (DRL). Each subdirectory is a self-contained project with its own training scripts, configuration files and environment dependencies.

## Repository layout

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DSAC-v2/` | Contains the code for the agents based on DSAC-T on the SparseReacher-v2 domain. |
| `gym-subgoal-automata/` | Contains the code for the C51 based agents on the OfficeWorld domain. |
| `minigrid/` | Contains the code for the C51 based agents on the MiniGrid-DoorKey domain. |

Refer to the README.md file present in each subdirectory to install the respective virtual environment and run the experiments.
