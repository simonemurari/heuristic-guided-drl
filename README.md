## XAI Project

In this repository you can find the code to run neurosymbolic versions of common RL algorithms such as C51 or DQN on the MiniGrid and OfficeWorld environments.

### Repository Structure

- **minigrid**:  
  Contains the implementation of the C51 algorithm and its variations using additional rules on the MiniGrid environment from Gymnasium. The code is adapted from CleanRL to work with MiniGrid.

- **gym-subgoal-automata**:  
  Contains the implementation of the DQN with rules and C51 with rules algorithms on the OfficeWorld environment.

### How to run

0. **Clone this repository**

1. **Follow the instructions in the README of each environment**  
   Each environment has its own README file with specific instructions on how to set up and run the code.
